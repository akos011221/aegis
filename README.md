Armor is a mitm (man-in-the-middle) proxy, that acts an as interceptor between client and target (website). It acts as a Certificate Authority (CA), which is a key function to be able to decrypt and look into HTTPS traffic.

It pretends to be the target website, by tricking the client into thinking that it is the real target website. In reality, it generates a fake SSL certificate (signed by its own CA) for the target website.
